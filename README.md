# COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS

## DATA

The data used in this covid-19 data analysis is taken from [kaggle covid-19 in India](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india?select=covid_19_india.csv).

## OBJECTIVES

### *COVID-19 VACCINATION DATA*

* Gender-wise vaccination details.
* People who experienced side effects.
* State-wise vaccination details.
* State-wise covaxin covishield sputnik details.
* Age-wise vaccination details.

### *COVID-TESTING DATA*
* Percentage of people tested postive w.r.t to testing.
* State-wise covid-19 cases.
* State-wise covid-19 testing.

### *COVID-19 INDIA DATA*
* Positive cases, deaths and cured count state-wise
* State-wise recovery percentage
* State-wise deaths due to covid-19 

## OVERVIEW
* In this project we perform Data Analysis and Data Visualisation on COVID-19 dataset to get insights.
* Data Analysis is done using SQL and the results are saved as csv files and shared here.
* The queries written to perform Data Analysis is also shared under the directory Queries.
* Data Visualisation is done using Tableau.
* Tableau is an Data Visualization tool. Using Tableau is simple.
* Using Tableau you can visualize your data in a structured way that is easier to get insights from.

## SAMPLE VISUALIZATION
* ![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66214509/133301386-caf0b92f-7c78-4ea7-9ea4-15be8dd38bfa.png)
* The map shows the vaccination and covid-19 cases state-wise in India.
* ![VACCINATION CURVE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66214509/129058636-8dd3aad6-d8d6-4521-9bd8-56a0e214c034.png)
* From the above plot we can see an exponential rise in vaccination count over time. Lets hope this trend continues. 
* ![Covishield or Covaxin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66214509/133301326-d28f9b54-5f4e-40ab-b705-f763d0e72665.png)
* From the above plot we can infer that most of the people got vaccinated with Covishield rather than Covaxin
